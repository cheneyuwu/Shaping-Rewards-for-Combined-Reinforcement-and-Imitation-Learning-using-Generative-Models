Meeting Summary<br>
December 21, 2018

## Project Idea/Definition/Goal
 - Non-determinism under reinforcement learning
   - Policy 
     - can be avoid using DDPG
   - Reward
     - usually deterministic in robot control environments
     - will vary between tasks in the context of multi-goal RL
   - State transitions
     - system dynamics can be non-deterministic
     - This is what
