## *Summary of last week*
- Read papers that were highlighted in our last meeting about exploration in RL, LfD and active learning. Also looked for other ideas.
- Set up simulators and played with some example environments.
- Looked into baseline implemntations of DDPG, DDPG+HER and DDPG+HER+Demo by OpenAI
- Went through experiments and result analysis from previous papers and though about evaluation and criteria of our task.

*TODO*
- One thing we did not discuss much last time was model based method. There are quite a few papers combining above ideas with model based methods, which I am currently reading.
- [OpenAI Robotics Research](https://blog.openai.com/ingredients-for-robotics-research/) also has a list of possible improvements to HER. I think some of them might be related to our idea (e.g. unbiased HER or HER+HRL).

## Implementations
- Looked into OpenAI implementation of DDPG and DDPG+HER. Trying to implement it on new tasks.
- Also exploring this repo [Surreal RL Framework](https://github.com/SurrealAI/surreal). If we use Robosuite, some baseline implementations here should be helpful.
